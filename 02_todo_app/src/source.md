## Part 1: Simple Todo List in React
Title: Creating a Simple Todo List in React with Best Practices

Overview: In this video, we'll start with the basics of building a simple Todo List in React. We'll focus on setting up the project, creating components, and managing state effectively.

What We Will Do Today:

Set up the React project.
Create the main Todo component.
Build the TodoForm component for adding tasks.
Use the useState hook to manage the list of tasks.
Implement basic form validation to ensure tasks are not empty.
Discuss best practices for component structure and state management.
Important Points to Keep in Mind:

Ensure your component structure is clean and maintainable.
Use controlled components for form inputs to handle state correctly.
Keep functions simple and focused on a single task.


## Part 2: Adding a Real-Time Clock to Display the Current Date and Time
Title: Enhancing Our Todo List with a Real-Time Clock

Overview: In this part, we'll integrate a real-time clock into our Todo List application. This feature will display the current date and time, updating every second to help users manage tasks efficiently.

What We Will Do Today:

Create the TodoDate component to show the current date and time.
Use useEffect and useState hooks to manage the clock's functionality.
Format the date and time for user-friendly display.
Integrate the TodoDate component into our main TodoApp.
Style the clock to fit seamlessly with our application's design.
Steps:

## Create the TodoDate Component:

Define the TodoDate component using functional component syntax.
Initialize useState for dateTime to store the current date and time.
Update the Date and Time:

- Use useEffect to set up an interval that updates dateTime every second.
Inside the interval, create a Date object to get current date and time.
Format using toLocaleDateString and toLocaleTimeString.
Update dateTime state with formatted date and time.
Clean Up the Interval:

Ensure interval cleanup in useEffect return function to prevent memory leaks.
Integrate TodoDate into TodoApp:

Import and include TodoDate component in the header of TodoApp.
Style the Clock:

Apply CSS to style the clock (date-time class) for clarity and readability.
Important Points to Keep in Mind:

- Use useEffect cleanup to clear intervals.
Format date and time for user readability.
Ensure clock styling matches application design.
Why Use useEffect for Cleanup
When using setInterval directly without cleanup, intervals continue running even after the component is unmounted, leading to memory leaks.
React's useEffect hook with a cleanup function ensures that the interval is cleared when the component is unmounted, preventing memory leaks.

## Part 3: Adding Delete Task and Clear All Task Functionality
Title: Adding Date, Delete and Clear All Functionality to React Todo List

Overview: In this video, we'll enhance our Todo List by adding functionality to delete individual tasks and clear all tasks at once.

What We Will Do Today:

Implement a delete button for each task to remove it from the list.
Create a clear all button to remove all tasks at once.
Update the state and re-render the list after deletion.
Discuss user experience and the importance of confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (optional).
Important Points to Keep in Mind:

Ensure that each task has a unique key for efficient rendering.
Handle state updates carefully to avoid unintended side effects.
Consider edge cases, such as trying to delete a task from an empty list.

## Part 4: Enhancing React Todo List with Reusable Components and Separation of Concerns
Title: Implementing Reusable Components and Separation of Concerns for Efficient Todo List Management in React

Overview: In this session, we'll optimize our Todo List application by refactoring it into reusable components and emphasizing separation of concerns. We'll integrate components for adding tasks (TodoForm), displaying tasks (TodoLists), and managing date/time display (TodoDate) to enhance code clarity and maintainability.

What We Will Do Today:

Refactor existing code to create reusable components:
Implement TodoForm component for adding tasks.
Create TodoLists component for displaying tasks and managing their actions.
Integrate TodoDate component for real-time date and time display.
Utilize props to establish communication between components.
Explore efficient state management techniques:
Utilize useState hook for managing task data within the Todo component.
Implement functions for adding, deleting, and clearing tasks.
Emphasize separation of concerns:
Ensure each component handles specific functionalities independently.
Maintain clarity and reusability by separating UI logic from data management.
Key Focus Areas:

Designing components to enhance reusability and simplify future modifications.
Implementing clear boundaries between components to improve code maintainability.
Demonstrating practical strategies for effective state management and component communication in React applications.
Next Steps:

By the end of this session, you'll have a robust Todo List application leveraging reusable components and separation of concerns, demonstrating best practices for scalable React application development.

## Part 5: Best Ways to Pass Keys and Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete
Title: Using Keys Efficiently and Toggling Task Completion in React

Overview: In this video, we'll dive into the best practices for using keys in React and add functionality to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

What We Will Do Today:

Discuss the importance of unique keys in React and how to generate them.
Show the best practices for passing keys, using objects for task data.
Implement the functionality to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
Update the state to reflect task completion and re-render the list.
Important Points to Keep in Mind:

Keys should be unique and stable. Avoid using indices as keys.
Use objects to store task data, including properties like id, content, and checked.
Ensure the UI reflects the completion state of each task (e.g., strikethrough for completed tasks).
Part 6: Adding Local Storage Functionality to Persist Data
Title: Persisting Todo List Data with Local Storage in React

Overview: In this video, we'll add local storage functionality to our Todo List, ensuring that tasks persist even after a page refresh.

What We Will Do Today:

Implement local storage to save and retrieve task data.
Update the state with data from local storage on component mount.
Ensure tasks are saved to local storage whenever the state changes.
Discuss the importance of stringifying data for local storage.
Important Points to Keep in Mind:

Local storage stores data as strings. Use JSON.stringify to save data and JSON.parse to retrieve it.
Handle cases where local storage is empty or data is corrupted.
Use useEffect to synchronize state with local storage on mount and state changes.
Part 7: Hosting the Todo List on Free and Paid Servers
Title: Hosting Your React Todo List on Free and Paid Servers

Overview: In this final video, we'll explore how to host our React Todo List application on both free and paid servers.

What We Will Do Today:

Discuss the differences between free and paid hosting options.
Walk through the process of deploying the app on a free server (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).
Show how to deploy the app on a paid server (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
Ensure the app is properly configured for deployment, including handling environment variables and build processes.
Important Points to Keep in Mind:

Ensure all necessary build steps are completed before deployment.
Check that the app is configured to handle routing correctly in a deployed environment.
Consider security and performance aspects, such as HTTPS and caching, when deploying to production.


1. Simple Todo List in React
- const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");
- useState is a React hook that allows you to add state to your functional components.

a. This is array destructuring. useState returns an array with two elements: the current state value 
    and a function that lets you update it. We use array destructuring to name these elements inputValue
     and setInputValue, respectively.
b. useState(""): This initializes the state variable inputValue with an empty string.
c. onChange={(event) => handleInputChange(event.target.value)}: This is an event handler that updates 
     the inputValue state whenever the user types something.  


- if(task.includes(inputValue)) return;
a. The line if(task.includes(inputValue)) return; is typically used to prevent adding duplicate tasks
     to a list. This condition checks if the inputValue already exists in the task array and, if so, it prevents further execution of the code (i.e., it returns early from the function).
